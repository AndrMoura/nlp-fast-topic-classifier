Can you write a swift struct version of the metal shading language's abstract syntax tree? I don't see how this structure would include the values of the data types. Would those not be needed? Could you provide a usage example for a simple metal shader? Can you write a SwiftUI view for creating or editing a structure like this?

"The misery of life never appears in a clearer light than when a thinking person has quite plainly seen with horror its hazards and uncertainties and the total darkness in which he lives; how he cannot find anything solid, secure, and beyond dispute on to which he can hold; when, as I say, after such thoughts he does not at once destroy an existence that is not one, but breathing, eating, drinking and sleeping are the solid things to which he clings and to which he returns as to a haven of security. But it is not so! The solid thing to which he clings is the knowledge that for the moment has only receded into the background, namely the knowledge of the eternal truth which is what keeps him in life at every instant. And just as breathing is necessary for the body lest it fail to serve the mind, so is it necessary for the mind that this may not sever the tie. If that knowledge comes to the fore, we have art and science. analysis rewrite and then analysis:The solid thing to which he clings is the knowledge that for the moment has only receded into the background, namely the knowledge of the eternal truth which is what keeps him in life at every instant. rewrite and polish: The solid thing to which he clings is the knowledge that for the moment has only receded into the background, namely the knowledge of the eternal truth which is what keeps him in life at every instant.",SpiritualInquiry,67840a63479baef1e2b6a25a2511da4d9ace5462afaa056d0e3e8245797b9e74
