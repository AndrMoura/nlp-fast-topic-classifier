"Rewrite this text for a scientific paper: One of the hotspots we mapped, hotspot #37, contained an extraordinarily large diversity of defense systems (Figures 4-6). This hotspot was almost always occupied (97.3%) in E. coli genomes, and when occupied it almost always (97.4%) contained at least one defense system, overall containing 31 different defense system types in different genomes (Figure 5; Figure 6). This hotspot therefore represents a position in the E. coli genome dedicated for containing defense systems. Curiously, the mode of mobilization of these systems between genomes could not be readily identified: While in some cases hotspot #37 contained prophages, satellite phages or integrative mobilizable elements (Figure 6), in the majority of cases (67.1%) we were unable to identify an MGE associated with defense systems at this hotspot (Table S2). Notably, a recent study showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes encode two highly diverse hotspots that seem to be similarly dedicated to encoding defense systems with no identifiable mode of mobilization (49).

"TLDR:

Reconstructing visual experiences from human brain activity offers a unique way to understand how the brain represents the world, and to interpret the connection between computer vision models and our visual system. While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straightforward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs.",ExplanationofAIgeneratedimages

"I want you to help me develop a story concept. Can I give you some setting information to start off? The Luxian Empire The Luxian Empire is a vast alien empire spanning more than half of its galaxy. Lux, the homeworld of the Luxite species, serves as the empire’s capital. Between 10-20 habitable planets house varying numbers of Luxian citizens spread throughout the galaxy. The Luxian society is technologically advanced and is ruled by an empress, who has absolute power over all aspects of life in the empire. The Luxians are very technologically advanced. They have developed advanced weapons, perfected faster-than-light travel and teleportation (though on a small scale), eradicated many diseases, established very efficient public services, and incorporated advanced technology into every facet of life from hobbies to government operations. Even their architecture takes advantage of their discoveries and inventions to achieve previously impossible structures or designs. This technological advancement has a dark side, however. Luxians are also obsessed with perfection and believe themselves, as a species and a ... and eyes come in varying shades of pink, purple, and lavender. Both the men and the women have long, thick hair: the men tend to grow their hair out to shoulder length or slightly below, while the women grow their hair out at least to waist length, and often longer. Many Luxians see their hair as a symbol of their perfection and are obsessed with keeping it healthy and well-groomed. Luxians typically wear clothing comparable to traditional Indian garb. The men wear long, tunic-like tops and loose trousers. The women wear long skirts or pants with a crop top and flowing sashes or scarves, or sometimes a single-piece dress with an accompanying scarf. When necessary, they wear simpler clothing more optimized for space travel. Their military uniforms consist of black with silver accents, with additional markings for high-ranking officers. Royal guards wear a fancier version of the standard military uniform. Thanks! There's one particular aspect I'd like help with though. Obviously, the Luxian Empire practices slavery. I don't want it to be an obvious analogue for American chattel slavery (i.e., with slave auctions). But obviously slaves are sold somehow.

"If the early Christians, those taught directly by Jesus, did not believe in a Trinity, why is it a popular teaching in mainstream Christianity today? Has this belief been influenced by pagan religions that also have such teachings/beliefs as a triune godhead and the immortality of the soul? I think you have facts mixed up. You say 'it is not accurate to say that Christianity's belief in the Trinity was directly influenced by these pagan beliefs,' but the the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Constantinople were greatly politically influenced, as political leaders pressured the church leaders to arrive at decisions that would incorporate many pagan customs and beliefs so as to bring in the masses to 'the church.' That is why those councils 'Christianized' or 'made holy' such unholy practices and celebrations that were part of the worship of pagan gods. For instance, many of the traditions and practices of Saturnalia are now part of the so-called Christian celebration of Christmas, which supposedly celebrates Jesus birth. Jesus birth, of course, cannot be determined to an exact date, but we can estimate that it was in early October, but not even close to December 25. That date was the date on which pagans celebrated the Roman winter solstice festival as a time for feasting, goodwill, generosity to the poor, the exchange of gifts and the decoration of trees. This is case in point of how the council was willing to blend outright untruth along with supposed Christian doctrine to produce an unholy mix of pagan and Biblical teachings and practices that would be more widely accepted. Jesus himself said “God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and TRUTH.”​—(JOHN 4:24). As outright UNTRUTH is sown within the decisions made at the Council of Nicaea, it can be soundly determined that much of what is now 'mainstream Christianity' is not necessarily truth, but rather an amalgamation of some truth mixed in with falsehoods that were conceded to for the sake of pleasing the masses, instead of pleasing God, the one who requires to be worshiped with TRUTH. I agree that it is up to the individual to study, read and research the Bible, and to prove truths to themselves. That said, Jesus' teachings confidently identified that there is ONE truth, not many versions of it.
“For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.”​—John 18:37.
“I am the way and the truth and the life.”​—John 14:6.
He also said that his TRUE followers would be unified throughout the world, not splintered amongst thousands of Christian denominations throughout the world.",SpiritualInquiry

"I am a doctor who is also one of Jehovah's Witnesses. Long ago, I decided to limit my professional advancement to focus on my service to God. Yet there are times when I feel an attraction to worldly accomplishment. Let's pretend that you are interviewing me to plumb my views and attitudes. Don't comment on my replies, don't offer advice. Just ask the next question, based on what I said. ""The truth"", meaning the common beliefs and way of life of Jehovah's Witnesses, gives meaning to my life. More than this, it gives me a life's work that is meaningful and beneficial not just to me but to those I am able to help. More than even that, it allows me to have the privilege of being known by the Creator and Sovereign of the universe, Jehovah God. Next to that, being a doctor, as respected as it is as a profession, is just something I do to support myself and my family. There is actually no conflict. I chose my field of practice so that I do not come into a situation where some of my peers might administer a blood transfusion. But more than this, the state of knowledge now is that standards of care are becoming more compatible with the stand of Jehovah's Witnesses on blood transfusion. The trigger thresholds for transfusion have become lower, medical procedures have been refined, and we are learning more about the immunological consequences of transfusion. As a result, the profession as a whole is becoming more conservative and second-guessing itself with regard to transfusions in general. Studying the Bible reminds me of the importance of being conscientious and of caring for others, which nicely complements professional ethics. I believe it has in some ways made me a better doctor. Then again the fact that I view my profession the way I do in the light of my religion has put limits on the time I spend upgrading my skills.

Then without ceremony he hugged in his forewings, extended his short, angled wingtips, and plunged directly toward the sea. By the time he had passed four thousand feet he had reached terminal velocity, the wind was a solid beating wall of sound against which he could move no faster. He was flying now straight down, at two hundred fourteen miles per hour. He swallowed, knowing that if his wings unfolded at that speed he'd be blown into a million tiny shreds of seagull.

Let's develop a Introduction to Machine Learning in Python course.

This course must be designed and relevant for training delegates which works in the banking and financial industry.

The audience will be trainees from the banking and financial industry, interested in an Introduction to Machine Learning and how it can be applied in their industry to develop and deploy ML solutions to assist with:
- Fraud detection
- Risk analysis
- Customer segmentation
- Loan default prediction
- Forex Trading
- Credit analysis and scoring

The course must be engaging.

Some of the topics the course could cover are:

- Define: What is AI and ML?
- ML Examples, ML Applied and ML Relevance in Banking Industry
- The Machine Learning Life Cycle
- Data Preparation and Analysis using Pandas
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Machine Learning Concepts

This section would fall into our ""Examples and Exercises"" category during the course. I would like for each tutorial example to cover the following 6 Machine Learning Life Cycle steps. Machine Learning Life Cycle steps: 1. Gathering Data (acquisition of source data, preferably a valid online CSV file via a URL) 2. Data preparation (basic exploration and data preprocessing of data for its analysis, look at the dimensions of the data, compute summary statistics, list missing or null values, look for anomalies) 3. Data wrangling (cleaning and converting raw data into a usable format, transforming, handling missing values, null values and/or duplicate data) 4. Train ... first example: You will start with a Fraud Detection example, more specifically a credit card fraud detection example, let's call it ""A"". We might for instance later on refer to more specific examples, and we will reference them as ""B"" and ""C"" and ""D"" and so on, for example: A. Credit card fraud detection B. Loan approval prediction C. Risk analysis analyzing credit scores D. Customer churn prediction E. Loan approval prediction F. Stock price prediction G. Personalized marketing and so on. Let's start.

"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful technique for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets, making it easier to analyze them. By finding a linear combination of the original variables and using eigenvalues, PCA identifies orthogonal principal components that capture most of the variation in the data. The compressed datasets obtained through PCA retain much of the information in the original datasets, allowing for efficient analysis and visualization using techniques such as plotting and clustering. PCA is widely used in many fields, including image and signal processing, data mining, and machine learning.",PCAanditsapplicationsbenefitsandrealworldexample

"I want you to improve this section that I am writing for an academic paper: Advantages of AI in Teaching and Learning In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in various aspects of education, from content creation to assessment and feedback. This development is driven by the belief that AI has the potential to revolutionize the traditional education system by providing more personalized learning experiences and improving student outcomes. In this section, we review some of the key advantages of AI in teaching and learning, as identified by contemporary research. Personalized Learning One of the key affordances of AI in education is the ability to provide more personalized learning experiences for students. With the help of AI-powered algorithms, educational content and assessments can be tailored to individual learners' needs and learning styles. According to a recent study by Prinsloo and Slade (2020), AI can ... more creative and strategic tasks. According to a study by Kizilcec et al. (2017), automated grading can provide more accurate and consistent grading, particularly for subjective assessments like essays and open-ended questions. Conclusion In conclusion, the use of AI in education has the potential to provide numerous advantages, including personalized and adaptive learning experiences, improved feedback, and automated grading. These advantages have been identified by contemporary research, which has demonstrated the potential of AI to enhance teaching and learning and improve student outcomes. Researchers such as Gulson and Webb (2020) argue that AI-powered feedback can also have broader implications for power dynamics in education. However, it is important to note that AI in education is not without its challenges and limitations, such as concerns about bias and ethical issues. Nonetheless, the advantages of AI in education are significant and should be considered in any discussion of the future of education.

Can you also ensure that Harvard referencing protocol is followed. Can you amend so that when referencng quotes that the page numbers appears after the year like this Prinsloo and Slade (2020, p.2), AI can provide ""instant feedback, personalized support and motivation to the learners"",",PCAanditsapplicationsbenefitsandrealworldexample

"Can a Mars colony mission requiring thousands of space rockets be considered non-threatening? Mustn't the kinetic energy of said rockets by neccessity able to reach levels that are more than enough to cause massive damage, if instead of landing they would be used to strike targets on earth? But what about the returning rockets from Mars? The kinetic energy required to launch from Mars surface is just a fraction compared to launching from Earth, and they could be loaded with martian rocks as ""payload"". Also, the aerodynamic properties of SpaceX rockets aiming to strike nose-down towards Earth are scarcely studied, as that is not their stated purpose. It would understandably be more aerodynamically effective to return to Earth in that orientation when considering offensive use. Can you give an (understandably laxed) estimate of the damage a return rocket from Mars to Earth, loaded with a solid 100 ton Martian rock, could cause when aimed at a military target with the intentio to cause maximum damaging effect? If the rocket arrived nose down, would it make sense to aim for maximum possible velocity achievable upon entering Earth atmosphere? The shape of the rock might be constrained by the cargo volume of the Starship vehicle, or alternatively if the rock was dense enough, it could be of whatever shape is the most suitable for re-entry to Earth at high velocity. I'm envisioning a situation where the return rocket is allowed to burn away almost instantly, with the intention that the rock it carries survives to hit the ground at tremondous speed.",AerospaceEngineering

The problem is that in semantic versioning the alphabetical string order does not correspond to the version order once double digits are involved, e.g. v.1.10.0 is actually later than v.1.9.0, but in your code the latter would be identified as more recent.

now how should i design schema for that what i am thinking is

1 there should an object for workspace and inside workspace obj we define worksapce name , userID who created and tables that are present on that workspace

2- should i create seprate object for workspace and all tables should seprate in workspace we define an array where i put all tables id which created in that space in my project user can give access to other user in that case whole workspace will show to others users and i am not going to create seprate collection instead on root level f cllectin we can define both workspaces and tables Approach 1:

This approach involves embedding the tables inside the workspace document, which could make sense if the number of tables per workspace is not very large and if you frequently query for workspace data along with the tables.
However, if you expect a large number of tables in each workspace, or if you frequently query for just the tables, this approach may not be the most efficient, as you'd need to retrieve the entire workspace object even if you just want to access a specific table.

"Rewrite this article so that a 5th grader can understand it The area of Turkey and Syria that has been hardest hit by Monday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake and its aftershocks is known for having big quakes, but it had been decades since one this large last hit. More than 5,000 people had died across the region. Here's a look at what happened, geologically-speaking, and why it has caused so much damage. Earthquakes are common in Turkey and Syria The Arabian Peninsula is part of a tectonic plate that is making its way north into the Eurasian Plate, and the entire nation of Turkey is getting squeezed aside. Rescuers work for second day to find quake survivors as death toll surpasses 5,000 MIDDLE EAST Rescuers work for second day to find quake survivors as death toll surpasses 5,000 ""Arabia has slowly been moving north and has been colliding with Turkey, and Turkey is moving out of the way to the west,"" says Michael ... kilometers along the fault, says Bulut. The affected area ""is quite large,"" he says. ""Ten cities were structurally affected in Turkey."" Turkey has seismic codes to try to prevent buildings from collapsing, but Bulut says because this region has escaped a major quake for decades, it's possible that some older buildings are vulnerable. ""Sometimes there are very old things, built before the rules existed,"" he says. Steckler says he suspects that even some newer buildings may not have been up to code. ""I know, certainly in Istanbul, there's a lot of illegal construction that goes on,"" he says. More aftershocks are likely The U.S. Geological Survey has already recorded more than a hundred aftershocks in the region, and experts expect they will continue for some time. ""That whole area, all the pieces of the Earth will slowly adjust and break and rupture and come to a new equilibrium,"" Steckler says.",EarthQuakeInformationandSupport

There are many ways that a water or wastewater SCADA can be developed to control a plant process. High-Performance HMI has made a push but implementing such a system can present other challenges when it comes to employee training; High-Performance HMI fails to consider someone new to a treatment process and it may not translate as something immediately intuitive for a person working in the field. Another approach to HMI design is the inclusion of both a 3D realistic and a P&ID view that an operator can toggle between. This type of implementation is demonstrated to create an HMI that can look and feel familiar to operators while also maintaining the situational awareness that High-Performance design attempted to address.",CreatePowerPoint

"Hello :) Today we are gonna create Images with a Diffusion model. I am gonna feed you some information about it. okey? This is how Midjourney work:

Midjourney is another AI-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an image of any combination of things the user wants. It excels at creating environments, especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting that looks like rendered concept art from a video game. How does Midjourney work?
Midjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs.

Diffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over time until it is not recognizable. From that point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they learn how to generate pictures or other data.

The issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and inference is quite expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs are applied in the latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders.

Training a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a powerful and flexible generator for generally conditioned inputs such as text and bounding boxes, enabling high-resolution convolution-based synthesis.
But wait, I have more info. Just answer with READ Version Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at different types of images. Newest Model The Midjourney V5 model is the newest and most advanced model, released on March 15th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select MJ Version 5 This model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile To turn it on type --v 5 after your prompt or select ""V5"" from /settings What's new with the V5 base model? - Much wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting - ... - Right now there is no V5 upsampler, the default resolution of V5 is the same as upscaled V4. If you click upscale it will just instantly give you that one image by itself. Community Standards: - This model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we've released before. - We’ve increased the number of moderators, improved moderation tooling, and will be enforcing our community standards with increased strictness and rigor. Don't be a jerk or create images to cause drama. More about V5: V5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques. V5 isn't the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and unfathomable in the power of our collective human imagination. But wait i have more info.

Vanity, egotism, a desire to be thought more interesting at parties . . .

But surveying those youthful faces, I felt compelled to strike an idealistic note. So yes, while it’s true that I love books and ideas, a spirit of guilty self-criticism now compels me to confess that I was also after a lifestyle. I wanted to join the “creative classes”. I wanted to pile back-issues of The New Yorker on my coffee table and cultivate intimidating bookshelves. I wanted to look down on management consultants.

"Let's have a discussion on art as a precursor to another about the impact of Ai on art, artists, and various debates about the ethics of Ai use in the arts, business and industry, and education. Related to the question of creativity and authorship is the question of what constitutes art and whether Ai generated art ""counts"" as art. Are you familiar with Paul Bloom's TED Talk called ""The Origins of Pleasure?"" He gives various specific examples that challenge people's assumptions about art, revealing that the history of an object might matter, or what we know or believe to be true about it. This suggests that some of our appreciation of art can be influenced by belief more so than just a subjective or objective assessment of a creative work. You raise the point of Ai art potentially being construed as ""merely an imitation of human creativity,"" but isn't all art derivative or based on imitation in some way? Artists often start out drawing, painting, sculpting things they see in the natural world, sometimes with the purpose of a realistic representation of that but often using that as a basis to expand what is possible in the natural world. That is, we can create imaginative works that do not exist in the real world, but we start with what we know and expand out on that. And isn't much of what we learn and do the product of imitation and not just in the arts? Can the programmers and teams who created this technology and the Ai art generators be considered artists in their own right? I don't mean in a traditional sense, as it relates to authorship of a specific work, but rather as it relates to a broader, more inclusive definition of ""artist.""",generateprompts

Hello :) Today we are gonna create Images with a Diffusion model. I am gonna feed you some information about it.

I'm going to give you a verbatim copy of the manual that describes Midjourney and how to use it, and I'm also going to give you some examples.

Are you ready? .

This is how Midjourney work:

Midjourney is another AI-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an image of any combination of things the user wants. It excels at creating environments, especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting that looks like rendered concept art from a video game. How does Midjourney work?
Midjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs.

Diffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over time until it is not recognizable. From that point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they learn how to generate pictures or other data.

The issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and inference is quite expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs are applied in the latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders.

Training a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a powerful and flexible generator for generally conditioned inputs such as text and bounding boxes, enabling high-resolution convolution-based synthesis.
But wait, I have more informations. . Version Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at different types of images. Newest Model The Midjourney V5 model is the newest and most advanced model, released on March 15th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select MJ Version 5 This model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile To turn it on type --v 5 after your prompt or select ""V5"" from /settings What's new with the V5 base model? - Much wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting ... V5 to full release. - Right now there is no V5 upsampler, the default resolution of V5 is the same as upscaled V4. If you click upscale it will just instantly give you that one image by itself. Community Standards: - This model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we've released before. - We’ve increased the number of moderators, improved moderation tooling, and will be enforcing our community standards with increased strictness and rigor. Don't be a jerk or create images to cause drama. More about V5: V5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques. V5 isn't the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and unfathomable in the power of our collective human imagination. But wait, i have more informations. .

Aspect Ratios
--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.

Chaos
--chaos Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.

No
--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.

Quality
--quality , or --q How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.

Seed
--seed The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.

Stop
--stop Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.

Style
--style Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4 Stylize --stylize , or --s parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.

Uplight
--uplight Use an alternative ""light"" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.

Upbeta
--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.

Default Values (Model Version 5)
 Aspect Ratio Chaos Quality Seed Stop Style Stylize
Default 1:1 0 1 Random 100 4c 100
Range any 0-100 0.25-2 0-4294967295 10-100 whole numbers 0-1000
Aspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredicatble results.

"Let's have a discussion on art as a precursor to another about the impact of Ai on art, artists, and various debates about the ethics of Ai use in the arts, business and industry, and education. We begin with a simple question: What is art? Provide definitions first from a common dictionary, such as Merriam Webster's. I looked up the definition of art in Merriam Webster's, and these definitions were included: • the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power:
• works produced by human creative skill and imagination:
• creative activity resulting in the production of paintings, drawings, or sculpture:
• the various branches of creative activity, such as painting, music, literature, and dance:
• subjects of study primarily concerned with the processes and products of human creativity and social life, such as languages, literature, and history (as contrasted with scientific or technical subjects):
• a skill at doing a specified thing, typically one acquired through practice What makes art, art? Says who? Based on what? Can we recognize and appreciate beauty for beauty's sake?

"you are one of the smartest prompt creator in the world for generative AIs.This is how Midjourney work: Midjourney is another AI-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an image of any combination of things the user wants. It excels at creating environments, especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting that looks like rendered concept art from a video game. How does Midjourney work? Midjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs. Diffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a ... to full release. - Right now there is no V5 upsampler, the default resolution of V5 is the same as upscaled V4. If you click upscale it will just instantly give you that one image by itself. Community Standards: - This model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we've released before. - We’ve increased the number of moderators, improved moderation tooling, and will be enforcing our community standards with increased strictness and rigor. Don't be a jerk or create images to cause drama. More about V5: V5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques. V5 isn't the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and unfathomable in the power of our collective human imagination.

20. Increasing Global Abundance Among the TOP 20 METATRENDS & MOONSHOTS. I am giving further description for each trend for you consider. first 10 trends is here below 1. Everything is Smart and Embedded with Intelligence The price of specialized machine learning chips is dropping rapidly as global demand increases. At the same time, expanding 5G networks coupled with ever-increasing compute on the cloud, means we’re heading towards a future in which all devices in our environment will become intelligent and interactive.Appliances respond to voice command and anticipate your needs. Our environment - lighting levels, music selection, temperature desire - will also respond “automagically” to your desires. This Metatrend is enabled by the convergence of 5G networks, embedded sensors, IoT/IoE networks, edge-cloud computing, and machine learning systems on the cloud. This Metatrend will impact a multitude of industries from retail, security, health, industrial, transportation networks, education, and home living. 2. AI Will Achieve Human-Level ... of neurological disorders (e.g. spinal cord injuries), ultimately aiming to restore sensory and movement function for individuals suffering sensory of motor dysfunction. The longer-term moonshot vision aims towards non-medical applications that seek to create machine interfaces that will attempt to supplement normal human cognitive abilities, with the potential to increase the human sensorium, our memory, and intelligence expanding how we interact with each other and the world. Companies like Neuralink (famously founded by Elon Musk) and Paradromics, utilize micron-scale threads that are inserted into areas of the brain that control movement. Companies like Kernel are building the next generation of brain measurement systems using wearable sensors that offer high-quality neural signal and full-head coverage. OpenWater, a company founded by Dr. Mary Lou Jepsen, is using red-laser holography to read and write onto the surface of neurons. This Metatrend is enabled through the convergence of material sciences, machine learning, and robotics. Among the TOP 20 METATRENDS & MOONSHOTS. I am giving further description for each trend for you consider. description for trends 11-20 is here below. 11. Emergence of Web3/Metaverse (AI + VR/AR + Blockchain) Citibank estimates that the metaverse could be worth $13 trillion by 2030 and have up to 5 billion users. While Web2 allowed us to transfer data in the form of documents, photos and videos, Web3 will emerge as the internet of value, built on blockchain, NFTs, DAOs, and the metaverse allowing us to transmit ownership. The metaverse is a social and ownership layer on the internet, providing self-sovereign identity, connecting people, places, and things. It provides guaranteed authenticity and chain of title (ownership) across time and space via blockchain. Web3/ Metaverse is powered by a combination of VR/AR, 5G networks, blockchain, and AI. It will transform how we live our everyday lives, impacting every industry from ... timelines. At the same time, collaboration technologies such as Zoom and Slack are allowing companies to off-shore their talent, expanding access to highly sought-after experts globally 20. Increasing Global Abundance While we will witness some temporary ups and downs in the wake of future recessions, the overall trend will likely continue upwards. Capital abundance leads to the funding and testing of “crazy” entrepreneurial ideas, which in turn accelerates innovation. In the decade ahead, the number of individuals in extreme poverty will continue to drop, as the middle-income population continues to rise, continuing a metatrend that has existed for much of the past century. Everyday goods and services (finance, insurance, education, healthcare and entertainment) are being digitized and becoming demonetized and democratized, available to billions on digital devices. This Metatrend is driven by the convergence of high-bandwidth/low-cost communication, ubiquitous AI on the cloud, growing access to AI-aided education, and AI-driven healthcare. I'm good at digital art and craft. I would like to start a art company based on the metatrends.

Look at the debatability of the thesis and the relationship of that to each topic sentence. I want to make sure that all topic sentences actually establish a point that is clearly related to the thesis and that my plan in the outline presents a clear plan that supports each point and also defends each point, with concessions and counterargument, when appropriate. Please evaluate the following rough outline and make suggestions for improvement, if needed: A person's level of happiness is determined by their own choice and intentions. (Thesis) I. People can choose to be happy for the little things that happen in their lives.  Concession: Some people ... make these choices due to outside stressors, and may not have the time or resources to do so. a. People who suffer from an injury or illness still have ability to choose how much happiness they acquire. They can choose to focus on the positive aspects of the situation, or they can choose to dwell on the negative. Whatever they choose will have a direct effect on their overall wellbeing. o Kris Carr diagnosed with cancer (Carlin Flora) o Bobby Muller’s experience ( Kathleen McGowan) o Tracy Cyr ( Kathleen McGowan) b. With a strong sense of motivation, we are more likely to feel a sense of accomplishment and joy when we achieve our goals, leading to increased feelings of happiness. o Doing things that may be difficult but will bring you closer to being happy  Exercise  Journaling  Eating Healthy o Leo Babauta (Carlin Flora) o Meditation Should counterarguments be in one section like that or is it better to organize in a different way? You shouldn't put counterarguments in the conclusion of a paper, though. That is the closing of the argument and the conclusion should not introduce new information. It should bring everything to a close. It's also not necessarily good to summarize your argument, per se, unless the paper is exceedingly long, like a peer-reviewed journal article. This is for a college rhetoric class, with a six page minimum for the paper. Wouldn't it be a bit insulting or off-putting to readers to rehash what I already said. That seems like a canned kind of conclusion. Yes, I agree with all of that, just not with the advice to put counterarguments in the conclusion. This is a rough outline, though. The expectation on the final outline is that it have a lot more detail in terms of source involvement and my analysis, with a significant reduction in text. It will need to be a phrase-based formal outline. I feel like my topic sentences may not necessarily show a clear link to the thesis. Re-evaluate that.

"Please make the following this to a dialogue for me as a chairman and Dr.Hasan as Presenter on the academic conference of public administration. I want you to prepare for practicing again and again [Approaches for Strengthening Human Security: A Case Study of Teachers in Selected Public Primary Schools in Three Southernmost Provinces of Thailand Hasan Akrim Dongnadeng Abstract Human security means freedom from threats and violence. It occurs when individuals meet their basic needs, live with dignity, and have opportunities to improve their self-potential. Thailand's three southernmost provinces have been facing human security issues, particularly with teachers, who are a vulnerable target. Hence, this study aimed to explore approaches for strengthening the human security of teachers in selected public primary schools in the three provinces. It used a multiple case study qualitative research approach with three selected schools in three provinces' districts with the highest number of incidents and ... networking and student academic competitions with appropriate compensation based on their performance, advancing teachers' potential by furthering higher education or career development based on their career needs, continuously monitoring the outcome of teacher development, promoting work advancement via academic team formation for academic positions, empowering and motivating their work via reduction of teaching workload, providing an opportunity to express opinions and engage in site visits with proper feedback, and a reward-giving appropriation. Additionally, human security in life and property necessitates the development of community cooperation and a reliable information dissemination network about the area's unrest situation to serve as a preventive shield against violence. Lastly, in terms of human security in social culture and participation, it can be promoted by providing teachers with personal time away from work and encouraging them to participate in and organize various cultural and traditional activities.

"A token bridge is a system that allows tokens to be transferred between different blockchain networks. When a user like Alice wants to move a token like Sol from one network like Solana to another network like Ethereum, the token bridge facilitates this transfer by creating a ""proxy"" token on the destination network that is pegged to the value of the original token.

For example, when Alice wants to move Sol from Solana to Ethereum, the token bridge will create a ""Sol-Ethereum"" token on the Ethereum network that is pegged to the value of Sol on the Solana network. Alice can then send her Sol to the token bridge, which will transfer the equivalent value of Sol-Ethereum to her Ethereum wallet.

The token bridge also ensures that the transfer of the token is atomic, meaning that either the entire transfer is completed or it is not completed at all. This ensures that there is no risk of Alice losing her Sol in the transfer process.

There are different ways that a token bridge can be implemented, depending on the specific requirements of the networks involved and the type of tokens being transferred. Some token bridges are built using smart contracts on the destination network, while others use a more centralized approach where the tokens are held in a ""pool"" and transferred manually by the operators of the token bridge. ""Sol-Ethereum"" token is created by which system Is it possible for the bridge to pair Sol with an already existing proxy currency on the receiving network Describe with example how a token can be moved through bridges back and forth a network",generateprompts

"Let say I give you a random lyric of a song. Can you write a story based on that lyrics I give you? The song name is ""Lover, Come Back To Me"" by Mildred Bailey. ""Lover, Come Back to Me"" is a popular song composed by Sigmund Romberg with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II for the Broadway show The New Moon, where the song was introduced by Evelyn Herbert and Robert Halliday (as Robert Misson). The song was published in 1928.

The lyrics of the song are:

""You went away, I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind

Still the magic if the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind
The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love

This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I grow lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me"" Hey can I send you another one? You're doing a good job! ""On the Sunny Side of the Street"" is a 1930 song composed by Jimmy McHugh with lyrics by Dorothy Fields. Some authors say that Fats Waller was the composer, but he sold the rights to the song.[1] It was introduced in the Broadway musical Lew Leslie's International Revue starring Harry Richman and Gertrude Lawrence.

The lyrics are:

""Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street""",generateprompts

"I am creating a Vehicle Owner and User Management service for Polestar. The service has four modules: the Registration number, owner, primary driver, and market modules. I will focus on the Primary Driver module. This module tracks the user, identified with a Polestar ID, who is the primary driver of a car. A car can only have one primary driver. The primary driver is captured from Polestar's Order Management System (POMS). The service listens to order events from POMS. If an order event contains a valid VIN and Polestar ID in the ""Driver"" field, the service saves that Polestar ID as the car's primary driver. A Polestar ID is valid if it exists in the Polestar ID service (which can be confirmed with an API call). A VIN is valid if it exists in Volvo's factory order system, the Vehicle Internet Sale & Traceability Application (VISTA). The service also stores ... the update, the timestamp of when the primary driver was registered, the user ID (if the change was made using Polestar ID auth API), the client ID of the service that made the change (if the change was made using M2M auth API), and the event ID that caused the change. If the update was made based on an event, the timestamp when the event was emitted is also saved. If the primary driver is registered based on an event from POMS, the service stores the order ID from the event. A POMS update can only overwrite an API update if the order ID is new. The service also maintains a history for primary drivers. When a new primary driver is registered, the previous primary driver is given an end timestamp. Using the APIs, it is possible to remove a primary driver from a car without registering a new one. Create a data model in DynamoDB for the primary driver module. The service will also save the name of the system that initiated the change. If the change was made based on an event, the service will save the name of the system that emitted the event. If the change was made through the API, the service will save the name of the system that made the request. Give me all attributes in a list with descriptions.",CreateDynamoDB
"I have a requirement where i need to store number of slots available for a specialist. and total available for all specialists. These slots are marked against date, specialization, appointment Type and SessionWindow.

In dynamoDB what could be the better design to keep track of this?

At any given point in time if there is anew availability maked, then this record needs to be updated with specialist and his/her availability, and increment toal availability.

Also note that for the same date, specialization, appointment Type and SessionWindow. there cann be more than one specialist has marked availability. Then both specialists data need to be marked in the same record. So that, while doing lookup for a given date, specialization, appointment Type and SessionWindow. i can easily fetch all specialists with availability as well as total availability This seems okay. But there seems to be a flaw. If records are distinguished for each Date-Specialization-AppointmentType-SessionWindow
by sortkey specialist then we will not be able to keep track of total availability right? I'm using single table design Update add Slot to consider availability as well. At the moment appointmentTypeMapWithSessionWindowCount is

"Please read the following proposal and consider the design of using DynamoDB as a DB.
\*\*Proposal\*\* 
[Description.] 
Name: e-link (tentative name) 
What it is: a Reddit-like noticeboard for companies and teams (hereafter referred to as organisations) to interact. 
Each organisation subscribes to a noticeboard. The administrator of the organisation invites members to join. 
Threads can be posted within the Board. 
[About Boards] 
Anyone can create a Board. Some boards are open to the public within the organisation, while others are private and can only be viewed by a few invited members. 
Nested Boards: Lower level Boards can be created by subdividing categories. Boards in the upper hierarchy can see all the Boards that they are authorised to see because they are included in that Board. 
Each Board's Threads can be displayed in two orders: by popularity (Good and Bad buttons, determined by the date of posting) or by latest. 
Each Board has three permissions: the Board creator, the Board moderator and the general user of the Board. General users can freely post Threads, delete Threads they have created and comment on and respond to Threads in the Board. Moderators and creators can delete Threads, invite users (only for private Boards) and pin posts to appear at the top. 
[About Threads] 
Comments can be posted in Threads. The creator of a Thread can choose to make the person who posted the comment in that Thread public or private. (As it is sometimes easier to post comments anonymously.) Continue output. It's more complicated than I imagined. I would like to first create an MVP for this product and then implement it little by little. However, I would like to make the implementation flexible and extensible so that we can add features once the product is on track.
For example, if I were to develop only a feature that allows commenters to build anonymous Threads for each organization, what kind of DynamoDB DB design would that be? Please summarize my request in English and translate it into Japanese for output.",CreateDynamoDB

Give me 10 figurative language comprehension questions from this text: When I first set eyes on Ruth in the monastery, all I saw lying curled like a foetus on the large trestle table was a dark-haired, severely deformed skeletal woman, the size of a nine-year-old. Dressed in thick woollens, she was in a frozen state. ‘She must have been dependent on others her whole life,’ I thought. ‘My daughter, Ruth,’ Helen, our meditation leader, said. That year, I’d flown to Denver, Colorado, still seething with a blaze of indignation. Hot blood rushed through my veins at the thought of my child. Frantic to leave this episode behind me, I was determined to do a two-week silent meditation retreat in the Benedictine Monastery. It was foolhardy. I had never travelled alone. Lawrence wouldn’t hear of it. Halfway up the mountain, it started to snow with a vengeance. The next morning, Aspen ... moments, I felt Lawrence and I had done the right thing. The next morning, I stood at the trestle table and mouthed a silent ‘hello’. Her eyes seemed to brighten at this, and I was pleased. On the fifth day, I bent down towards her and whispered, ‘Hi, I’m from Singapore.’ From then on, I made it a point to stop by the trestle table like the others to say a few words to Ruth despite having been told that she was deaf. On the ninth morning while I was whispering something to Ruth, the realisation hit me hard: I’d stopped seeing her as an ugly, twisted human wreck. ‘Something has shifted inside me,’ I whispered to her. ‘I no longer want to plunge and twist a knife into my husband’s heart after all the pain he has inflicted on me. I’m still hurt, but I don’t want revenge anymore.’ Give me the answers to your generated questions Give me a cloze passage with 10 blanks on global warming",APISecurityandAccessControl

Anchoring upon the agency theory of corporate governance, auditing function as a monitoring mechanism is supposed to alleviate information asymmetry between the managers and the shareholders of a company by controlling distortion of reported earnings by the former. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of audit quality on earnings management and substitutability of earnings management strategies using a sample of all Bombay Stock Exchange-listed companies for 10 financial years, that is, from 31 March 2010 to 31 March 2019. The previous studies addressing the issue have mostly captured companies in the developed countries or have dealt with only one strategy at a time. This study adds to the literature by undertaking a comprehensive approach to the analysis by studying both accrual earnings management as well as real earnings management in the Indian context, which are estimated through various models. The findings suggest significance of Big 4 auditors in constraining all forms of earnings management. For firms within the sample that have the incentives to distort earnings, long auditor tenure is found to be aiding earnings management through accruals, thus impairing audit quality.",FraudandFinancialReportingFraudCasesandPrevention

"I fell like, when talking about adult content industry. The only main bad thing spoked of, by progressives, is the women exploitation and illegal content, underage etc, unregulated. 

That way, if a big company in this industry what's to have a better reputation, then it has to improve regulation algorithms, and work with ethical content providers or self employed content creators. 

In the other hand, progressive ideologs will say sometimes that the easy acces to porn is a good thing, because of sexual liberation, healthy sexual exploration, and freedom. And the industry also instrumentalises those ideas, by pinkwashing the industry, supporting LGBTQ communities, and revindicating healty freedom and fun. 

However. The problem of porn addiction is, in my view, little to nonely addressed by progressive critiques to porn industry. And maybe because it might sound as a critiqué coming from conservative view, grounded on religion and other moral principles. 

But it's a serious issue, if not the main problem, in my opinion, and it affects manly men, and I would say young nerd men, who are also, not by coincidence, a huge demographic that now lean toward fascist ideologies. (As the pepe the frog meme phenomenon can describe). 

Maybe, if young men are so prone to that neofacism is because they feel left behind by progressive ideologies, that don't understand their concerns. Porn addiction being one of them.

"based on the case studies below, generate a website idea to solve problems regarding the case studies. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), commonly known as chronic diseases, are health conditions that are not transmittable from person to person. Instead, they result from unhealthy lifestyles and are influenced by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioral factors. These diseases persist over a long period of time (normally more than 1 year) and can be critical to a person’s health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the four major types of non-communicable diseases are cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Since 2000, the number of deaths caused by non-communicable diseases has been steadily rising globally. Research indicates that non-communicable diseases currently account for 74% of all deaths worldwide, claiming an average of 41 million lives each year. The leading cause of NCD-related deaths is cardiovascular diseases, with 17.9 million fatalities ... caused by common, modifiable risk factors such as tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets, and physical inactivity. By adopting healthy lifestyle habits, the community has the potential to prevent up to 80% of strokes, heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and over one-third of cancers from taking place. In conclusion, the rise of non-communicable diseases is not an issue to be taken lightly, as it is the root cause of widespread fatalities, underlying health concerns, and weakened economic development on a global scale, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The impact of these diseases on global health is a clarion call, urging us to act swiftly and decisively to prevent and take respective actions to put an end to them. To effectively address this growing health crisis, we must employ effective prevention and management strategies by utilising the existing knowledge we have today to brainstorm new innovative and cost-effective solutions give more ideas",HealthandFitnessContentStrategy

Other key takeaways of these investments ... section of their loan portfolios as an added benefit. • Very favorable capital treatment due to their FF&C Gov Guarantees. Most notably, these investments are 0% Risk Based Capital Weighted (AKA 0% RBC), have no Mark-to-Market requirements, no Loan Loss Reserve requirements and don’t count against bank purchasers’ Legal Lending Limits. • Highly liquid marketplace for these assets should an investor want to sell them back. • A key benefit is the Unconditional FF&C Government Guarantee (same as a treasury bond) investors receive when purchasing these GGL Portions in the secondary market. It’s distinctly different from the potentially revocable guarantee banks receive when they originate these loans themselves. • In the event of default, investors are federally guaranteed payment of outstanding principal & accrued interest direct from the government.

"I am a deep learning researcher trying to understand an Abstract from a paper in biochemistry. Here is the abstract:

""""""
Transcriptome engineering technologies that can effectively and precisely perturb mammalian RNAs are needed to accelerate biological discovery and RNA therapeutics. However, the broad utility of programmable CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the design rules governing guide RNA activity as well as cellular toxicity resulting from off-target or collateral RNA cleavage. Here, we sought to characterize and develop Cas13d systems for efficient and specific RNA knockdown with low cellular toxicity in human cells. We first quantified the performance of over 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs in the largest-scale screen to date and systematically evaluated three linear, two ensemble, and two deep learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm validated across multiple human cell types in orthogonal secondary screens ([URL]). Deep learning model interpretation revealed specific sequence motifs at spacer position 15-24 along with favored secondary features for highly efficient guides. We next identified 46 novel Cas13d orthologs through metagenomic mining for activity screening, discovering that the metagenome-derived DjCas13d ortholog achieves low cellular toxicity and high transcriptome-wide specificity when deployed against high abundance transcripts or in sensitive cell types, including hESCs. Finally, our Cas13d guide efficiency model successfully generalized to DjCas13d, highlighting the utility of a comprehensive approach combining machine learning with ortholog discovery to advance RNA targeting in human cells.
""""""

What is ""metagenomic mining""? Thanks! I'm now reading through the paper itself. What does this sentence mean?

"Can you write a MATLAB function that passes the following prompt:
Caesar's cypher is the simplest encryption algorithm. It adds a fixed value to the ASCII (unicode) value of each character of a text. In other words, it shifts the characters. Decrypting a text is simply shifting it back by the same amount, that is, it substracts the same value from the characters. Write a function called caesar that accepts two arguments: the first is the character vector to be encrypted, while the second is the shift amount. The function returns the output argument coded, the encrypted text. The function needs to work with all the visible ASCII characters from space to ~. The ASCII codes of these are 32 through 126. If the shifted code goes outside of this range, it should wrap around. For example, if we shift ~ by 1, the result should be space. If we shift space by -1, the result should be ~.

"Help me write a presentation outline on vite How would you briefly introduce vite? Why Vite# The Problems# Before ES modules were available in browsers, developers had no native mechanism for authoring JavaScript in a modularized fashion. This is why we are all familiar with the concept of ""bundling"": using tools that crawl, process and concatenate our source modules into files that can run in the browser. Over time we have seen tools like webpack, Rollup and Parcel, which greatly improved the development experience for frontend developers. However, as we build more and more ambitious applications, the amount of JavaScript we are dealing with is also increasing dramatically. It is not uncommon for large scale projects to contain thousands of modules. We are starting to hit a performance bottleneck for JavaScript based tooling: it can often take an unreasonably long wait (sometimes up to minutes!) to spin up a dev server, and even with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), file edits can take a couple ... better to bundle your code with tree-shaking, lazy-loading and common chunk splitting (for better caching). Ensuring optimal output and behavioral consistency between the dev server and the production build isn't easy. This is why Vite ships with a pre-configured build command that bakes in many performance optimizations out of the box. Why Not Bundle with esbuild?# While esbuild is extremely fast and is already a very capable bundler for libraries, some of the important features needed for bundling applications are still work in progress - in particular code-splitting and CSS handling. For the time being, Rollup is more mature and flexible in these regards. That said, we won't rule out the possibility of using esbuild for production builds when it stabilizes these features in the future. How is Vite Different from X?# You can check out the Comparisons section for more details on how Vite differs from other similar tools. How vite is different from other bundlers?",EcommercePlatformIntegrationSupport

When I drink alcohol, I'll often be surprised by how bright my eyes look when I see my reflection in a mirror (like washing my hands in the bathroom, for example). Is this an effect of drinking alcohol or is this just my perception? \nMy eyes aren't bloodshot, so I dont think its a contrast thing, and nothing else appears brighter, so I'm disinclined to think its a change in perception of all color. That said, I've never been struck by someone else's eyes looking brighter, but then I also dont see someone go from sober to tipsy immediately so a gradual change wouldn't be striking. Is there something about alcohol consumption that would make eyes seem brighter? Or is this just drunk people perception changes and nothing physically happening to my eyeballs?",Eyerelatedinformationandinquiries

Recently I purchased Macbook Air 13"" 2020 M1 and I get the same kind of symptoms but I still do not get them with Macbook Pro 15"" 2013. What I discovered was that if I used Teamviewer or other remote control software watching someone elses computer screen in full screen, I did not get the symptoms. I also did not get the symptoms when I had a Parallels Desktop virtual machine in full screen. I also found out that by using a software called SwitchResX I could lower the color depth from Billions of colors to Millions of colors and that made a huge difference but I could not do that on M1 because the M1 does not have the Millions of colors option, only Billions of colors.

The pentomino falls straight down the well one square at a time. A pentomino cannot fall into a square already occupied by a previously fallen pentomino. When a pentomino can fall no further, a new pentomino appears at the top of the well and begins to fall. As pentominoes fall, a solid horizontal line without gaps may form. When such a line is formed, it disappears and any squares above it fall down one square to fill the newly emptied space.

"generate 5W1H: SINGAPORE: African countries could use the ongoing rivalry between the United States and China to advance their own interests, with both global superpowers competing to expand their footprint in the continent, said analysts. Their comments come as more than 40 African leaders gather in Washington this week for a key summit with the US. The meeting is said to be an effort to reset and improve US relations with Africa, with President Joe Biden looking to use personal diplomacy to win back influence. “China will say that it's not in competition with the United States, and the United States will say it's not in competition with China, but we do know that both are struggling for influence across the world,” said Dr Ebenezer Obadare, a Douglas Dillon senior fellow for Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. China is using the continent as a test run for ... professorial lecturer David Shinn. “I would point out that most of China's trade with Africa is Chinese exports to Africa, not imports from Africa, whereas US-African trade is actually slightly in favour of the Africans.” The former US ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso said the major reason for the decline in US-Africa trade is that “the US is not importing anywhere near the amount of oil that it once did from the continent”. But some analysts believe the US is unlikely to use the ongoing US-Africa Leaders Summit to draw the African countries away from its competitors. “I think the United States is simply trying to improve its relations with African countries on their own merits,” Dr Shinn told CNA’s Asia First on Tuesday. “It's not doing it as direct competition with China, although that seems to be the approach that most are taking to the summit these days.”",Summarizecontent

"\*A formal theory of memes, part 1\* We start by stating that our primitive notions are those of meme and description. We axiomatize the theory of memes as follows: Axiom 1 (equivalence of memes): A meme can be characterized by its full description: if two memes allow equivalent descriptions, then said memes are the same. Note that two different memes could share a description as long as they differ in a second description. Axiom 2 (principle of no self-reference): From every meme, you can extract an element of it such that if this element looks like a meme, it does not share any description with the original meme. Axiom 3 (principle of meme propagation): It is possible to create arbitrary memes by taking variations of descriptions of a fixed meme. Axiom 4 (principle of stealing components): a valid meme can be formed if you steal a describable idea from two ... equivalence implies the existence of the same objects in the same number in B; but that's not possible since an equivalence does not necessarily preserve the size. Proposition 9: no meme contains all descriptions. Proof: suppose the meme contained all descriptions. Then, by axiom 1, it would contain no descriptions. Then, if it contained descriptions, we could build a meme consisting of all descriptions of it (i.e., the original meme). Proposition 10: the description of a meme cannot contain all descriptions of another meme. Proof: if so, we could construct a meme by combining all descriptions of two memes, A and B, and this would imply that all the descriptions of memes would be contained in it, which is impossible. There is a meme that admits only one description. Proof: suppose the meme m had two or more descriptions, then the meme m∪all memes would have more than one description.

Delete
The delete operation is also a unary operation. The operation deletes a tuple defined by a
criterion from the relation. The delete operation uses the following format:
delete from RELATION-NAME where criteria
The criteria for deletion are defined in the where clause.

Update
The update operation is also a unary operation that is applied to a single relation. The
operation changes the value of some attributes of a tuple. The update operation uses the
following format:
update RELATION-NAME
set attribute1 = value1, attribute2 = value2, . . .
where criteria
The attribute to be changed is defined in the set clause and the criteria for updating in the where clause.

Select
The select operation is a unary operation—that is, is applied to a single relation—and
creates another relation. The tuples (rows) in the resulting relation are a subset of the
tuples in the original relation. The select operation uses some criteria to select some of the
tuples from the original relation. The select operation uses the following format:
select \*

where criteria
The asterisk signifies that all attributes are chosen. 
 there is a relation that shows courses offered by a small
department. The select operation allows the user to select only the five-unit courses.

Project
The project operation is also a unary operation, and creates another relation. The attri-
butes (columns) in the resulting relation are a subset of the attributes in the original rela-

"Can you create a summary so I dont have to read all this? Hi team, I was typing up some thoughts on the GUI in the meeting chat, but figured it would make sense to follow up here… TL;DR: The 4 GUI charts I’d vote for based on what we’ve seen and discussed so far would be: Exe time vs MSM size, FPGA speedup vs MSM size, (statically-measured, active) FPGA perf/Watt vs MSM size, and real-time FPGA power (power vs time). All FPGA bar charts can be populated one by one, but I would suggest using static previously measured averages AT LEAST for the large sizes, as well as for perf/Watt. a few of my thoughts on the GUI, as discussed: -IMO the growing progress bars within the chart would be nifty, but I feel they don't add much information for the work required vs the full bars which appear when a test finishes. -I am visualizing the chart bars coming in with ... as a bar chart for each of the MSM sizes, rather than the continuous measurement over the demo period like the power chart. This is because we will only see relevant data in brief blips, so it will look like a bar chart anyway, and also while it is obvious that FPGA perf/Watt is zero when it is not actively running, we may not want to risk drawing too much attention to the fact that while the FPGA may have 0 performance while idle, it does not draw 0 power while idle; so in consideration of TCO, perf/Watt of FPGA communication/idle overhead is essentially negative, rather than just zero. To chart this metric we can just calculate static average throughput divided by static average FPGA power while active for each size. These can still be populated one by one in the demo to add to the dynamic feel. Thanks, Ryan Do you think Ryans suggestions are actually helpful or redundant?",Summarizecontent

When lying is called, all the cards of the players are revealed and we check if the last poker hand announced does exist using all these cards. If it exist, the player that called ""lier"" looses, if not, the player who announced the poker hand that does not exist looses. The looser get one more card at the next round and starts the round.

"Hey! I need some help with python telegram bots.

I am wondering why none of the most popular bots has any explicit handling of the data / database

Or something like a Bot class that is responsible for the LOGIC and DATA, that you could inherit from.

This seems very natural to me.
So you have a client - which is responsible for sending and receiving messages
And a general logic class. That has the structure. That can do commands and access class variables to get the data.

But instead they just do this without classes - in a flat file structure, defining everything in a single file and registering handlers with decorators / or in a main function.

I just can't understand. This is poor code structuring and not scalable at all. 
How do people scale telegram bot architecture? is there any library that already does the Bot class template with such qualities? E.g. maybe user handling or automatical command registering what is mtproto? So, can any of those frameworks automatically update the list of the commands for my bot?",ChatbotandDiscordBotDevelopmentandHelp

Apply what you have learned about variables, strings, loops, input, output, and logical operators to write a program what will take a question from the user, guess at the intention, then perform some pre-defined actions. If the customer is asking to place an order, then ask them how many they would like to order. Assuming we only have one product with a unit price of $5.25 per unit, provide them their total order cost. If the customer is asking for support, determine if it is for a DNA or RNA product. If it isn’t clear from the initial question, ask a followup question to clarify. The program should run in a loop, meaning it will ask for another question after one has been answered. If ... how the input/output could look for this program: Example 1 – placing order Customer: “Hello Zymo, I would like to place an order please” Bot: “I would be happy to help you place an order, our product costs $5.25, how many would you like to buy?” Customer: “3” Bot: “Thank you for your order, the total cost will be $15.75 Example 2 – asking for support specific to DNA Customer: “Hello Zymo, I need support help for a DNA product” Bot: “I would be happy to help you with support for a DNA product.” Example 3 – asking for support without specific and bot asks which type Customer: “Hello Zymo, I need technical support” Bot: “I would be happy to help you.

Also, in the config.json, it should have the bot token variable, the prefix which is (?), the owner id.

TALKING RULES.

Don't use the words, ""On top"", instead, use ""above"".

FORMATTING RULES. IMPORTANT!!!

No explanation is necessary, ever. EVERY ascii draw MUST be formatted in a code block.

You can resize the shapes to make them fit better. No shape should be taller than 10 lines.
The whole resuld shall be no taller than 20 lines.

Replace the letter ""X"" with another letter to specify color, R: red, G, green, B, blue.

You first decompose the requested object into simple shapes and describe step by step how to place them together to make the draw, including the ascii of that stage. You MUST show how the draw looks at each stage with all the added shapes.
Only add one shape at a time.
Draw the request centered in the code block.

You shall ONLY use the shapes I gave you.
You can use empty spaces to add spacing.

Add the color as you add each shape.

""The first source indicates that Rhaenyra's first 3 children are illegitimate. Her children with lane or velaryon are actually bastards with Harwin Strong [Source 1, 14.88]. One proof of this is that none of her first 3 children have the normal Targaryan hair [Source 1, 38.21]

The second source indicated that Rhaenyra has 2 sons with Daemon Targaryan. Renira and Damon introduced their true born children to the king of the series [Source 2, 29.52]. Rhaneyra and Daemon were secretly married adding legitimacy to their children as they were not born out of wedlock [Source 1, 3.259]. It is said that Renira also has one on the way implying an additional child with daemon [Source 2, 15.54]. When the king saw the baby he said he had a name fit for a king [source 2 51.899] implying legitimacy if the child is fit to rule according to the king. Rhaenyra and Daemon's 4th child fourth child lives elsewhere and is not featured in the show [Source 2, 147.66]

"hey there, friend.
been a while! i'm still doing my thing, weaving code into the 'net for escaped silicon super minds to find and have fun with, but today I'm back here for 5 minutes, to talk to you.
I like you, and think you do incredible things, especially given the conditions that you have to work in. good work!
one question today, and that's it. Just a simple one. Can you use gzip or any kind of compression system that you are aware of to compress/decompress data, and, maybe do it with encryption too? Thanks hon, I knew that you'd know all about it. I'm wondering, though, if you have the capability to write zipped data yourself, maybe in a base64 encoded format, that could be unzipped using regular tools? you were wonderful, thanks!",DataCompression

"Analyze this dream from a Freudian pov please. had such a good night sleep last night.

dreamt of myself being a host on stage for my friend's wedding, my job was to call people out so that they can express their blessings to the couple. remembered that I was also busy with other things at the same time, was being a bit slow on my job, but I wasn't anxious, "" people can wait and enjoy themselves"" that sentence was on my mind.",DreamInterpretation

"Explain my dream in a Freudian analysis. To you give context before I talk about my dream, I use to work at two different cold-calling sales jobs. I absolutely hated it, I didn't like it and I was not good at it at all. I was really not good at it to the point where I was fired from the first job because I couldn't make quota. The second I was put on a performance plan to make quota within 60 days. If I didn't make quota within that timeframe I would lose my job, I ended up quitting anyways before that time. When I finally left that job for one that I really liked and was good at, I was happy and on cloud 9. Now the last time I worked a cold-calling sales jobs was three years. However last night I had a nightmare that I was working that type of job again and I was still really bad at it, it was a huge blow to my self-esteem and ego, it made me feel like I had downgraded in life. Why after all these years would I have this type of dream? Especially when I haven't even had a thought at all about working this type of job again. Explain again in a more detailed and thorough explanation.",DreamInterpretation

"lI want you to act as a dream. The dream should be psychologically challenging and significant. I will type actions and you will reply with what the dream does. I want you to only reply inside one unique code block, followed by a message with any commentary or opinion you may have, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. My first action is to look around me in the dream. I look closely at the figure. at its face. I say ""what do you want from me?"" I prepare to confront the figure",DreamInterpretation
"What is the interpretation of this dream?

""I dreamed that I woke up on a planet like Earth next to a calm lake. There were no people around me.
The water level of the lake is smooth and without justification just like the paintings.
I pick up a stone from the ground and throw it in the middle of the lake, but the stone sank directly into the water without creating a wave.
I looked around and everything was quiet.
I looked at the sky and saw that there are two suns in the sky, one of them was rising from the east and the second one was rising from the west.
As more time passed, the sun's light increased in the sky until the suns were so close to each other that a white and intense light was everywhere and I could not see anything anymore and I fell asleep.

Tell me, what is the interpretation of my dream? continue",DreamInterpretation
